1. Set up CilkPlus
2. Do multiplication example from here (slide 27): https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall10/cos597C/docs/Cilk.pdf
----- First way: divide the task as 1 spawn for each element
----- Second way: divide the task as equal sized subtasks (binary tree)
----- Compare the performance by varying number of threads from 1 to 32 ---- AA
3. Do fibonacci example from here (slide 9): https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall10/cos597C/docs/Cilk.pdf
----- Use only 1 spawn call
----- Use two spawn calls (same as slides)
----- Compare the performance by varying number of threads from 1 to 32 ---- BB
4. Read CLRS Chapter 27: Multithreaded Algorithms
----- Understand the analysis from the book. Reason the performance in AA and BB. 
----- Coding exmaples: matrix multiplication, merge sort
